## üõ† **Senior Design Project**

### **SmartPark: An IoT-Driven Automatic Parking Solution**  
**Project Duration:** January 2024 ‚Äì December 2024

**Project Description:** SmartPark is an innovative IoT-driven parking solution designed to simplify the urban parking experience by guiding drivers to available parking spaces in real-time. This system leverages IoT sensors installed at each parking space to monitor availability and relay data to a central server, where it is processed and displayed on a user-friendly mobile app. The app provides real-time updates, allowing drivers to locate, reserve, and pay for parking spots effortlessly. This project addresses urban congestion and reduces the time spent searching for parking, contributing to a smoother and more efficient city infrastructure.

**My Role:** As a core developer on this project, I‚Äôm involved in deploying and managing IoT sensors, building backend systems for data processing, and developing both web and mobile applications. I am responsible for implementing robust backend logic that processes and stores sensor data, as well as creating intuitive user interfaces for easy navigation and payment processing.

**Skills & Knowledge Gained:**
- **IoT System Integration:** Practical experience deploying sensors and integrating them into a centralized system.
- **Backend Development:** Developed data processing and management systems for high efficiency and low latency.
- **Frontend Development:** Created intuitive, user-centered interfaces for web and mobile platforms.

**Big Picture Contribution:** By providing a solution to urban parking issues, SmartPark demonstrates the power of IoT technology in addressing real-world problems and improving the quality of city life. This project illustrates how interconnected devices can create a seamless experience for end-users while contributing to smarter urban planning.

## üìö **Projects**

### **UNIX Shell and Multithreaded Server**

**Description:** This project involved building a custom UNIX shell that replicates essential bash functionalities, including command execution, process management, and background processing. Beyond the shell, I developed a multithreaded server application that manages concurrent transactions for a banking system. Through this, I explored mutex locking mechanisms and the implications of different granularity levels, ultimately optimizing for system performance and resource management.

**My Role:** I led the design and implementation of both the UNIX shell and server, focusing on achieving high performance and reliability. The server‚Äôs thread management allows it to handle multiple client requests simultaneously, demonstrating an understanding of both coarse and fine-grained mutex locking techniques.

**Skills & Knowledge Gained:**
- **Concurrency and Multithreading:** Experience in designing and managing threads and locks for optimized performance.
- **Systems Programming:** Developed a deep understanding of UNIX-based systems, shell scripting, and process management.
- **Performance Tuning:** Explored and implemented performance improvements through lock granularity adjustments.

**Resources Used:** C++, POSIX threads, Linux systems
